25,cnn-test-4761dc6d8bdf56b9ada97104113dd1bcf4aed3f1,M20,"( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

80,cnn-test-b1c3fc03a2b74cf4c79844c1fe2fdce70a8a436e,M0,"Rome ( CNN ) Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe . From Friday to Monday , a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued , according to the Italian coast guard , which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress .

Most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said Rassol Omar , a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends northern Iraq 's semi-autonomous Kurdish region . Omar did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it . The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga , who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital , Irbil , said Nuri Osman , an official with Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government . It was n't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday 's release , Osman said . Osman said 217 Yazidis were released . Omar , the Peshmerga commander , had a higher count : 228 . ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year . The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq 's north last summer , forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes . Yazidis are of Kurdish descent , and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity , Judaism and Zoroastrianism . One of the oldest religious communities in the world , the Yazidis have long suffered persecution , with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers . ISIS ' cruelty to them has been extraordinary . ISIS ' conquest of the town of Sinjar , in particular , provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria . ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds , Yian Dakhil , the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq 's Parliament , told CNN last year . Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives . An international coalition responded , first by airdropping supplies in the mountains . Rescues came next . And then , starting in August , the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population . CNN 's Raja Razek reported from Beirut . CNN 's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta .

The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly ' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites , according to police . Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window , tying a rope around the rifle case 's handle or a cable lock , and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case 's handle free from the lock . The window frame of the agent 's car was pulled from the door , which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window .

The hotel does not have surveillance cameras , according to the police report . Salt Lake City police said the rifle 's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer . The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama 's visit , but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security .

Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half . 'It 's important to win a match and gain some continuity , ' De Sanctis said . 'The last ( four ) months were tough in terms of results . So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride .

They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30 . Meanwhile , Napoli 's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches , and Diego Maradona 's former club remained fifth . Security was tight for Napoli 's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season 's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico . Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis ( right ) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order . But there were no reports of problems . Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post . A few minutes later , Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi , who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in .

In the second half , De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions . The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th . Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net .

At the same time , managers at the passport agency , which made a £42 million profit during the chaos , received up to £3,500 in bonuses . Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through , and even to some who missed out on trips . Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz , who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation , said last night : ‘ I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office , especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds. ’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents . By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system . Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service , but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this . Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time . Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office . In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year , scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year . The total paid out was £203,066 , giving an average sum of £92.68 . The biggest single payout was £5,463 ; the lowest £1 . The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected , partly because of ‘ the system failure of our customer complaint database ’ . It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated , saying : ‘ It would create a precedent. ’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished ' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time . Only one had got money back . Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham . They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco , where he had planned to propose , because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades . HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year . In 2013-14 , the most recent figures available , managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses , with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500 .","Managers at the passport agency made # 42 million profit in bonuses .

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places , exposing what used to be the ocean floor .

1203,dm-test-b5925c1a02fa9a8f6b1d5ad764c19a732deac0df,M13,"A video of a menacing crocodile swimming through a public marina with a dead pet dog locked in between its jaws has been viewed more than half a million times online . The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta , in Mexico , with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth . New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages , not moving at all ' . Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop 's owner . Scroll down for video The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina , in Mexico 'There 's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river ( 200m away ) which runs out to the sea and the marina , ' Mr Weston explained . 'The dog went to the water 's edge to see the crocodile ( being curious I guess ) but things did n't go according to plan obviously . 'It was certainly a shock to the system . Guess that 's nature though , ' he said . In the video the beast glides through the water , with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other , as crowds gasp in amazement . New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when he saw the alarming sight Tourist Tim Weston took a photo of the crocodile with the dog between its jaws A video of the crocodile swimming through the marina with the bike shop owner 's dog has been viewed more than 500,000 times Mr Weston said : ' A couple of hours later we walked back past and there was still a crowd ... But we did n't want to look at it again as we had just eaten . Yesterday morning there was no sign of either . ' Social media users have reacted in horror to the video that was posted on the Bogged Facebook page . One woman called the video 'horrible ' and another said ' I hate crocodiles now ' . But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries .

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 .

' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager .

Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote .

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls . ' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties . He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions . Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order . Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said : 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be . 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties , so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency .
