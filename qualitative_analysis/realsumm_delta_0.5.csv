I was trying to keep telling myself it 's a long year . Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship . ' The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw . ' I was really pleased at how comfortable i felt in that situation , last group in the masters on sunday . I think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon . ' Rose began the final round four shots behind spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine , but was never able to get any closer . ' There 's two ways to look at it . You can think that 14 under par , i 'll take that next year and i 'll take that the year after and i 'll take it the year after , so i have to take a lot of confidence from that , ' he added . Rose had struggled to hit top form going into the masters but now hopes to sustain his augusta form . Rose ( left ) congratulates tournament winner spieth and praised his performance level for the week . ' But you 've got to play it on the day , too . I felt like there were a few moments out there where i could have done better and i 'll learn on that and think about that . ' Jordan did n't really open the door and i did n't really expect him to . Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole . I felt that if i make my birdie putt and jordan misses for par , it 's a two-shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play . But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day , really . '",Justin Rose finished joint runner - up at the Masters 2015 on 14-under - par .

244,10,t5_out_11B.txt,"Her neighbour ’ s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and , says audrey alexander , has left parts of her garden in deep shade . What ’ s more , it now seems likely to remain that way . Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size , the council has ruled they can stay . It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of mrs alexander ’ s family . It kicked off 35 years ago when mrs alexander ’ s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii . A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge . Then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour jeanette robinson to trim the hedge . She claims mrs robinson refused and declared : ‘ i would rather move than touch these trees . ’ the dispute rumbled on , with mrs alexander , 54 , claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property . She sensed an opportunity , however , with the passing of the high hedge act in scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases . Stirling council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour audrey alexander 's house ( pictured ) . The situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed . Audrey alexander ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that mrs robinson can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft . Mrs alexander said the ruling made ‘ no difference ’ . The high hedge act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden . Complainants and the hedge 's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort . Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear , disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached . The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice , which orders owners to cut the hedge back , or decide not to act .

257,10,matchsumm_out.txt,"Her neighbour ’ s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and , says audrey alexander , has left parts of her garden in deep shade . What ’ s more , it now seems likely to remain that way . Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size , the council has ruled they can stay . It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of mrs alexander ’ s family . It kicked off 35 years ago when mrs alexander ’ s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii . A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge . Then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour jeanette robinson to trim the hedge . She claims mrs robinson refused and declared : ‘ i would rather move than touch these trees . ’ the dispute rumbled on , with mrs alexander , 54 , claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property . She sensed an opportunity , however , with the passing of the high hedge act in scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases . Stirling council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour audrey alexander 's house ( pictured ) . The situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed . Audrey alexander ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that mrs robinson can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft . Mrs alexander said the ruling made ‘ no difference ’ . The high hedge act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden . Complainants and the hedge 's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort . Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear , disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached . The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice , which orders owners to cut the hedge back , or decide not to act . The local authority can not make any orders about the roots of the hedge .

Markman insisted ' she has a lot of potential as a reporter ' , adding , ' she is young , she ’ s learning some things , but i really do believe in her . ' He continued : ' we had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard . She knows that , and especially at the beginning . ' She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers . We expect that from her , and i expect that from her . ' She did a great job for us on the nfl last year in some difficult situations and i have seen nothing that doesn ’ t make me think she will rebound from this . But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy . ' Online petitions for mchenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released . The verbal attack on april 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office , where clerk gina michelle was stood behind the counter .

Mchenry seems unfussed , responding : 'that ’ s why i have a degree and you do n't - i would n't work in a scumbag place like this . Caught red-faced : incredibly , mchenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant , however continued to insult the woman 's looks , education and job on-camera .

Just wanted to clarify that . ' After a few more comments , including telling michelle she does n't have a brain , mchenry delivers her biggest sting .

The firm showed magnanimity , saying it did not want mchenry to suffer . In a statement advanced towing said : ' parking enforcement is contentious by nature . At the same time , neither gina , our lot clerk , nor our company , have any interest in seeing britt mchenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments . ' Ms mchenry is our neighbor , and , as she said , to paraphrase , made remarks that were out of line . She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment . ' Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family . Gina holds no ill will toward ms mchenry .

Michael , has spent £7,500 on a hair transplant which he believes will boost his self-esteem and happiness . His mother , joy , who never spends money on herself and wears £5.99 shoes from oxfam , is amazed her son is prepared to spend so much on changing his appearance . She points out that he could go on a luxury holiday for the next seven years for the same price . But michael said of the treatment : ' it will make me feel more complete . It is a lot of money but this means a lot to me , good holidays come and go but this will last a lifetime and make me a happier more confident person . ' Joy , however , is worried that her son , a divorced father of two , is pinning too much on the hair transplant changing his fortunes of her son .

She said : ' i just want to feel normal , to feel like a normal shape and do things without thinking about it all the time . ' Of the price she is paying to have the body she wants , she said : ' it is expensive . I am pretty comfortable but it 's a lot of money . I think it 's a price worth paying . ' Following the procedure , emma said she had no regrets but the operation was ' a lot harder than i thought it was be ' . She said : ' my legs were black and swollen for weeks , at first i felt like my legs were going to explode . ' I have n't had regrets but i did n't realise how much it takes a toll on your body .

723,30,refresh_out.txt,"Residents living yards from the scene of the £60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime . They also claim to have heard ‘ drilling ’ noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . Scroll down for video . Arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . Residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . Farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : ‘ my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . ‘ but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . Protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . ‘ but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . Also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' Miss begum added : ‘ it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . It happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . ’ career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . Another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : ‘ we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . It was late at night on the friday or saturday . I ca n't remember which . ‘ i heard some type of noise . I 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . But i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? ’ former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . Mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . On saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . Described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . Saturday , march 28 . Thursday , april 2 . Friday , april 3 . Saturday , april 4 . Sunday , april 5 . Tuesday , april 7 . Mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . Instead he 's come back for more . ' I do n't think this was part of the plan . But criminals are greedy . ' Mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . Cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . At 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . A street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . The men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . On good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . At 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . From 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . In total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . Scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . A police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' He added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally . It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . Meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary .

They also claim to have heard ‘ drilling ’ noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . Scroll down for video . Arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . Residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . Farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : ‘ my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . ‘ but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . Protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . ‘ but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . Also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' Miss begum added : ‘ it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . It happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . ’ career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . Another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : ‘ we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . It was late at night on the friday or saturday . I ca n't remember which . ‘ i heard some type of noise . I 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . But i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? ’ former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . Mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . On saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . Described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . Saturday , march 28 . Thursday , april 2 . Friday , april 3 . Saturday , april 4 . Sunday , april 5 . Tuesday , april 7 . Mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . Instead he 's come back for more . ' I do n't think this was part of the plan . But criminals are greedy . ' Mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . Cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . At 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . A street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . The men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . On good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . At 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . From 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . In total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . Scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . A police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' He added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally . It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . Meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . Kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . The 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . Mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . Where were the gang from ? Speculation over the gang ’ s origin has been feverish . Possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . However , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . An accomplice on the inside ? The men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . Furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company ’ s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . Another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . Loot smuggled out of the country ? Some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . Whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . According to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be ‘ a doddle ’ . What about the ‘ king of diamonds ’ ? A criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . The only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . The panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . He and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with £13million worth of jewellery .",Locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist . They also tell of suspicious ' drilling ' noises on evening of Good Friday . Group seen returning to scene on Saturday - a day after initial break - in . Police admit they did n't respond after alarm went off early on Friday .,Residents say they were hit by 'peculiar ' power cuts a week before the heist .

Failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . Previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror .

The former soviet state has gained the most from the strong pound , which has cut the cost of visiting the continent . Resorts on its black sea coast offer the best value in terms of a meal out , buying a cup of coffee and essentials such as sun cream and a cold drink , according to a study . Scroll down for video . Affordable : bulgaria has been named europe 's cheapest destination , with black sea resorts like sunny beach ( pictured ) offering the best value in terms of a meal out and other holiday activities . Hotspot : bulgaria 's most popular resort of sunny beach is a carbon copy of those of spain and greece . It is one of 13 european hotspots out of 14 where your cash will go far further this summer , largely thanks to rock-bottom exchange rates and higher inflation in some countries . Research into an imaginary shopping basket of ten typical holiday purchases showed a total price of £37.39 for bulgaria , which is down by 13.6 per cent from last summer . There was a bigger fall of 22 per cent for the algarve in portugal , taking the total cost to £44.02 , helping it beat spain 's costa del sol to become the second cheapest destination . Only in turkey , where inflation is 7.6 per cent – compared to virtually zero in britain and the eurozone – will britons find the cost of a day out much more expensive . The figures , compiled for the annual post office holiday costs barometer , show the spending basket in turkey is up by 21.4 per cent on last year , at £65.70 . Bulgaria 's most popular resort of sunny beach is a carbon copy of those of spain and greece . Described by travel agents as ' lively ' , it has a wide sandy beach , high-rise hotels , bars , restaurants and water parks . It also has a long summer season from may to september and boasts around 300 days of sunshine year – more than miami beach in florida . Peak-season return flights to burgas airport cost £400 a head . Once there , a three-course meal for two with wine comes in at £19.60 , and a cup of coffee at 78p . The country , whose currency is the lev , also has some popular ski resorts . The research is good news for travellers to the algarve , which offers good-value restaurants , with a three-course meal for two including wine costing just £16.42 , while a coffee will set you back 52p . At the other end of the scale , sorrento in southern italy is the dearest resort . Its basket costs £101.60 – almost three times bulgaria 's .

Andrew brown , of post office travel money , said : ' meal prices can have a big impact on the holiday budget and make a big dent in holiday finances for people who plan to eat out every night .

A saudi prince has promised to give a free bentley to every pilot involved in the yemen air strikes , as bombing raids in the country appeared to resume despite a pledge that they would stop . Saudi arabian forces launched air strikes on yemen a month ago to stop advances from the shiite houthi rebels , who are allied with iran and previously overthrew the saudi-backed government . Prince alwaleed bin talal , the saudi king abdullah 's nephew , has reportedly promised to give each of the 100 fighter pilots involved in the month long raids in riyadh , the saudi arabian capital , a free bentley . Prince talal , who owns $ 300 million stake in twitter , apparently made the pledge on social media but the post has since been deleted , the international business times reported . He wrote : ' to recognise the one hundred participating saudi pilots i am pleased to present them with 100 bentley cars , ' on tuesday the saudis said the bombing raids , which have killed at least 944 people and wounded around 3,480 , had been successful and they were to focus on finding a political solution instead . But the raids appeared to have resumed by wednesday , with fighting taking place in taez . Dozens more people are said to have been wounded or killed . Bin talal , 60 , is the grandson of saudi arabia 's founder ibn saud and one of the richest men ion the world . He has an estimated fortune of $ 23 billion and investments in london 's savoy hotel , apple , citigroup and news corp . He has previously gifted 25 bentleys to members of a saudi football team and in 2013 threatened to boycott forbes magazine for underestimating his wealth and saying he was only in 26th place in a list of the world 's richest . Almost 1,000 people are thought to have been killed during four weeks of air strikes by saudi arabian forces . The prince , who is a billionaire , has pledged to give each of the pilots involved in the air strikes a bentley . His comments were met with criticism on twitter , as well as supporters of those in yemen who have been killed in the month long airstrikes . Saudi forces began its military campaign , called operation decisive storm , on march 26 . They were launched to stop the advancement of shiite houthi rebels who had previously overthrown the saudi-backed government and ousted president abed rabbo mansour hadi . Saudi arabian forces pledged that air strikes which destroyed areas of sanaa would stop on tuesday , but they appeared to resume again on wednesday following advances by rebels on the ground in yemen . After four weeks hadi had still not be reinstated and the rebels still retain control of the capital sanai . The saudis announced yesterday an end to the ' successful ' operation decisive storm and that they would be moving to a new operation , dubbed ' restoring hope . ' This is to focus on security and counter terrorism and was said to involve a downscaling of military activity . However the saudi-led coalition had warned it stood ready to counter against any advance by the rebels - and appeared to take action today as fighting resumed in the second city of aden as well as taez . In taez , the rebels took advantage of the lull in air strikes to overrun the headquarters of the 35th armoured brigade , loyal to hadi , an army officer said . The conflict has created severe shortages of food and other supplies by closing sea and airports .","Air strikes were launched by Saudi forces a month ago against rebels .

1120,46,unilm_out_v2.txt,"A four-poster bed which was dumped in a hotel car park and sold for £2,200 has been verified as once belonging to king henry vii – and it could now be worth millions . The intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester , by builders who were renovating the property . Oblivious to its true value and historical significance , the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers . The four-poster oak wood bed ( above ) , which was dumped in the car park of redland house hotel in chester and later sold at auction for £2,200 , has now been confirmed by dna as once belonging to king henry vii . The intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and , oblivious to its true value and historical significance , left it to be picked up by auctioneers . It was snapped up for £2,200 in 2010 by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland who spotted the item , which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival , on the internet . However , he was shocked when his new ' victorian ' purchase arrived and approached tv historian jonathan foyle with a suspicion that the bed was , in fact , the only surviving tudor bed . Since then , mr foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii . He said tests confirmed it was european oak and of a sub-species ' typical of the origin of the finest , slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites ' , with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age . ' Under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . He has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . Mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . Henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . The bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for £2,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . Tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . He also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . The strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . The carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . Meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . Mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . The bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . The strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . The bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . He said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . Henry viii may have been conceived in bed . The carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . It is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . Born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . Under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . Jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . It has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' He added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' Experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son . ' Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of christ and mary ; it 's henry viii 's god complex in a nutshell . ' Dr foyle described the 15th century artefact , which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in england , as ' a complete national treasure ' . He added : ' evidence suggests the bed was made for the painted chamber of westminster palace for the marriage ceremony at westminster abbey on january 18 , 1486 . ' Mr foyle is backed by other experts , such as diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church at oxford university , who described the rediscovery as ' exceptionally important ' . The medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to £20million , although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display . It is part of the ' a bed of roses ' exhibition at the childhood home of anne boleyn , henry viii 's second wife , at hever castle in kent which also features a portrait of henry viii as a young man . The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in england . In 2013 , the battle-scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in leicester . Meanwhile , in december of the same year , archaeologists uncovered a site in the amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of atahualpa , the last emporer of the incas . And last year , explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to alfred the great in the grounds of hyde abbey in winchester . Henry vii 's four-poster bed will remain on display in the long gallery at hever castle in kent until november 22 .","Four - poster bed dumped in a hotel car park and sold at auction for £ 2,200 .

That 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! I shot him . I 'm sorry , `` bates said in a video of the shooting . But it 's happened before . In a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . The former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . So how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? Here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . So if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . Bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , `` bates said in a written statement to investigators . After bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , `` said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , `` brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . `` Brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . In his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher `` to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . Bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled `` by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , `` he told investigators .

1366,56,t5_out_base.txt,"Simon wood , 38 , from oldham won masterchef last friday . Wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next gordon ramsay or jamie oliver should take note - it does n't have to cost a fortune . The new winner of masterchef simon wood , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson . Everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self-taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows . He told mailonline : 'it ’ s all self-taught . There ’ s no more to it than that . You can achieve anything if you try hard enough and you ’ re passionate enough . ' I learnt what i know from reading , websites like youtube , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it . ' I also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen . ' I can ’ t help it , it ’ s like watching tv and if it ’ s happening in front of you , you can ’ t help but watch what they do . ' While simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven . The lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the wood household lunchboxes can become works of art . He said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i ’ m practising . ' All of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you ’ re at my house . ' Everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it ’ s in the fridge or freezer it ’ s likely to come out at some point or another . 'they ’ re not fussy at all though . They ’ re like me , there ’ s nothing i don ’ t like and that has carried on through to them too . It makes life a lot easier . ' Scroll down for video . Simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight , he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper . But he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young . The couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam . Simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . The hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon decided to take up a career in it instead . His children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired . He said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming . ' It was a moment in all of our lives that we ’ ll remember and will treasure and look back on . ' Simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg wallace , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers ' . Simon said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they ’ re practically idols of yours and you ’ ve not met them before that . ' Then it all starts to get very real very quickly . It ’ s a daunting prospect that ’ s in front of you . ' So the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really . ' But simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . He won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti-frutti . Simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . He said : ' you grow so quickly when you ’ re down there . You get feedback from people that you ’ d never normally meet and they ’ re so good at what they do - everyone down there is . ' I got loads of really good feedback down there . I had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves – i think it showed as well . ' For anyone looking to follow simon 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it . He said : ' if you don ’ t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you haven ’ t made something you believe in or enjoyed making . That comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that ’ s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience . ' If you don ’ t enjoy it i don ’ t think your guests will either . ' Simon has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster . As a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink . He said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did christmas dinner for the first time . ' I had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock . ' I simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock . ' Then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i didn ’ t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on – think about what you ’ re doing . ' I don ’ t think there is anything i can ’ t cook though . I think i ’ ve shown throughout the competition that i ’ m good with most things that get thrown at me . ' Simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . While he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette . He said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette . ' And if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad . ' Nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that ’ s it – done . ' Just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette . ' But anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant . For the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie . He said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually – it ’ s every cook or chef ’ s dream . ' If you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing . ' I think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it ’ s really good . ' I think i ’ d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist . ' Something that looks nice , is achievable . But is also quite opulent and refined and nice . ' Also something that isn ’ t out of everybody ’ s reach . '","Simon Wood , 38 , from Oldham won Masterchef last Friday .

In february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence . But today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . Sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ' man of honour ' . Although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed . The case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) .

He was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . During protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . In his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment .

1479,61,t5_out_11B.txt,"A sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped . Domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . In february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence . But today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . Sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ' man of honour ' . Although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed . The case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) . Rancadore 's solicitor , karen todner said : ' yesterday the italian court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence . ' I am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' There has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' Ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . Once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . The italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . Domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . Rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . Although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . Known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . He was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . During protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . In his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' Before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . Rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . Before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . There was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . Extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . After two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' Mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' It transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' So certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request `` . ' Courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' It is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' Had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' Domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . Asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . Barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' There was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . Curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . One neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . She went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' The neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . A court sketch of domenico rancadore . Today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . Sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' They are very quiet . I would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . Also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . Groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . Most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . Only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . It has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than €10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . Politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . The american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' He 's very quiet . He always has been , even before it all blew up . They are a very quiet family . ' Federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' That is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' It gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' Mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . A cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' It is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' Until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' The cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . At the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .","Domenico Rancadore given a seven - year sentence by Italian court in 1999 .

For baby boys , teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100 . The highest new entry was kian . Popular : between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . Above , harper with her brothers and father last month . Girls . Alpha - alpha may be the first letter in the greek alphabet , but it ’ s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls . Not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the us , when alpha was number 301 . It dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good . Barbra - singer barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . Barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the top 1000 , but barbra is about to vanish . Claudine - this feminization of the ancient roman name claudius ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . Claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls ’ names are now out of favor . Nanette - nanette ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956 . But today , most parents say no to nanette . Sheba - sheba is the short form of the biblical bathsheba , disappearing from view with only five baby girls named sheba in the us in 2013 . Sondra - sandra ’ s exotic sister sondra ranked in the top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939 . But the devastating hurricane sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013 . Thisbe -thisbe was never ranked in the top 1000 , but this ancient mythological name – she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired romeo & juliet – is about to vanish from the modern lexicon . Zelma - zelma nearly broke the top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955 . Selma , thelma , and even velma , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage . Boys . Elmo - just over a century ago , this short form of guglielmo , the italian form of william , stood at a respectable number 247 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view . Any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from sesamestreet . Icarus - a dramatic greek mythological name , icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences . His name has never broken into the national top 1000 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name . Inigo - inigo is another name that ’ s never ranked here , though it ’ s admired enough on nameberry to make it number 261 . It ’ s the medieval spanish version of ignatius , which has ranked as high as number 602 on the national list and was used by cate blanchett , but inigo is a no-go . Llewellyn - a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s . But despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn seems headed for extinction . Remus - with his twin brother romulus , he was a legendary founder of rome . But the stereotypical image of uncle remus , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the top 1000 . Sherwood - the stiff surname sherwood , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist sherwood anderson , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , anderson ’ s heyday , but it hasn ’ t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then . Waldo - where ’ s waldo ? He ’ s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year . Waldo actually reached as high as number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .","Gary fell from 147th most popular British name in 1996 to 1,001st in 2013 . Reached height of its popularity in 1964 , when it was ranked 16th . Meanwhile , names including Dexter and Jenson are now in the top 100 .","The name Gary - once one of the most popular name in Britain - is now heading for extinction . Just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the UK in 2013 were given the name , data from the Office of National Statistics shows . That compares to 235 Garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in Britain . Helped by the popularity of actor Gary Cooper , there was a surge in Garys born in the US in the early 1950s .",0.8571428571428571,0.13532838864420793,0.7218144684986492

But despite much excitement surrounding her first single , she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts . Then a year later came her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , which failed to chart in the top 100 . Some , including the script frontman and former voice coach danny o'donoghue , believe leanne did n't have the right work ethic .

' Everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . Andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment .

Andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . Will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . Hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . If a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . The singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . Despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . Compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited .

Stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism .

No pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than the voice uk .

The designer revealed in february that he would not be presenting a collection at the sydney event this week , and revealed to daily mail australia on sunday that he was enjoying ' taking a breather ' . Despite this year marking the 20th anniversary of mbfwa , perry is taking in the fashions from the comfort of the front row , after focusing on his international efforts of late . ' My team and i just need a bit of a breather - we 've just finished selling in paris , and we 've had an incredible season over there , so we 're busy focusing on international at the moment , ' perry told dma at the ellery show on first night of fashion week . Scroll down for video . Perry pulls out of presenting : acclaimed designer alex perry opts out of showing at this year 's mbfwa . ' We 're busy working on cruise too , ' ( perry 's popular party dress collection ) . ' I wouldn ’ t be standing here talking to you if we were showing on monday or tuesday , ' he laughs . This is only the second fashion week the design powerhouse has missed in two decades . When asked if he will miss the excitement of running his own show , perry said while he loves it , he 's happy to sit back and see it from a new perspective . ' The chances i do get , i love to take in the whole thing , my eyes will be wide open as i sit in the front row , ' he says . ' Because i 'm not presenting a show i can really look forward to supporting some of my friends like kym ( ellery ) and johnny ( schembri from by johnny ) they 're my two faves i 'm specifically wanting to see . ' Fashion favourite : perry says kym ellery ( pictured left ) is one of his favourite designers showing this week . On kym ellery 's show , perry says she had a great cast of models and knew the fashion would be beautiful and all about showcasing shape and new directions . As for what he sees trending this season , perry said the australian market is so diverse , anything could happen . ' There are so many different designers with so many styles now , it ’ s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that , there are so many handwritings , so i think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week . ' ' someone like kym is so incredibly on point internationally at the moment which is her style , but then johnny is going to give us some fun , sexy tight stuff . ' Fashion flashback : showing since 1996 , this marks the second time in twenty years perry wo n't show . Model moment : perry with cheyenne tozzi ( pictured left ) who previously starred in australia 's next top model . Perry also believes the australian market has it 's on unique flair , different to fashion internationally that has a more uniform look . ' We definitely have our own signature . I would n't say relaxed even though people say that all the time , it ’ s more we have a different take on fashion . There 's a mix of designers that are increadibly accomplished then there are younger designers who take more risks and challenges , ' he says . ' And at the same time you can australian designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it . ' Taking a break from the runway , perry now is devoting his time to international enterprises , with a specific focus on the asian and middle eastern market .

However , rodgers was emphatic that moving to city would not represent a step up . ‘ if you say that city is a bigger club than liverpool , you ’ re wrong , ’ he said . ‘ i ’ ve got big respect for what city are doing — they ’ re trying to build it the right way . But at this moment you can ’ t compare the size of the two clubs . ‘ you ’ ve got liverpool and united , the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years . I wouldn ’ t say we were a development ground for going to “ bigger ” clubs . ’ city have tried to sign players from arsenal and liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals . They have bought gael clichy , emmanuel adebayor , bacary sagna and kolo toure from arsenal but failed to lure fernando torres when he was at anfield . Sterling is wanted by manchester city this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract . Sterling has been one of liverpool 's leading lights and was nominated for pfa young player of the year . This summer , liverpool will also try to sign james milner from city . Rodgers hopes victory over villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players . ‘ our vision is to win trophies , ’ he said . ‘ the first objective was to get into the champions league again . We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy . We just have to concentrate on performance levels , get to the final and we ’ ll take it from there . ’ club captain steven gerrard is available after a three-match ban and rodgers has to decide whether to start with him in what could be his final appearance at wembley before his move to la galaxy . Rodgers is set to welcome steven gerrard back into the squad after his three-match suspension .",Manchester City have been linked with summer move for Raheem Sterling . Sterling has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal . Brendan Rodgers says a move to City would not be step up for Sterling . Indicating it will take the Manchester club 20 years to eclipse Liverpool .,"Brendan rodgers says that a move to manchester city would not be step up for raheem sterling . Ahead of sunday 's fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley , rodgers indicated it could take two decades for sheik mansour 's club to reach the status of either liverpool or manchester united . Liverpool manager brendan rodgers has written off manchester city 's chances of signing raheem sterling this summer by declaring the anfield club are bigger than their etihad rivals and making it clear they have no intention of becoming their feeder team .",0.8333333333333334,0.2695284192116898,0.5638049141216436

2085,86,two_stage_rl_out.txt,"A cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories . Olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version the easter feast , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . The breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk . The easter feast breakfast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . Up for the challenge : customer glen keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar . The meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons . For £7 , customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate easter egg , with one half used as a bowl , served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure . Two cereals of choice are added together with a creme egg , a handful of mini eggs , home-made chocolate brownie and a flake chocolate bar . Marshmallows and m & m 's are thrown into the mix , before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce . He starts off in high spirits , pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate ' bowl ' . Mr keogh takes on the easter feast ( left ) but barely gets through before he regrets his decision ( right ) . Finally , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry , vanilla and good old semi-skimmed . Mr taylor , whose cafe specialises in world cereals , milkshakes and cheesecake , says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into black milk . He created the easter feast challenge to celebrate the gluttony of easter . Cadbury 's chocolate egg ( 291g ) : 150g sugar ; 1,400 calories . Baked caremalised white chocolate : 9g sugar ; 80 calories . Kosher cereal from israel : 8g sugar ; 150 calories . Toffee crisp cereal : 7.2g sugar ; 150g calories . Home-made brownie : 7g sugar ; 410 calories . Creme egg : 26.5g sugar ; 177 calories . Mini eggs : 20.5g sugar ; 148 calories . Flake : 16.7g sugar ; 171 calories . Dulce de leche : 50g sugar ; 315 calories . Salted caramel sauce 10g sugar ; 300 calories . Milks : 30g sugar ; 300 calories . Marshmallows : 40g sugar ; 75 calories . M & ms : 13g sugar ; 140 calories . Total : 3,816 calories . Average man needs 2,500 calories per day . ' It 's all in the spirit of easter , ' he said . ' Easter is less about what is used to mean , and now on easter sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them . ' No one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the bank holiday to see if anyone can . ' He said the initial idea for the easter feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market . ' I want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said . Although his cafe may stake a claim to creating britain 's most tooth-rotting dish , mr taylor is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , special k and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack . Sweet-toothed customer glen keogh bravely attempted the challenge , opting for toffee crisp and a kosher cereal from israel as his two choices . He said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first . ' After tucking straight into the crème egg , the flake and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting . ' The cereal was delicious , but like the easter egg bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble . ' Ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare . My nine-year-old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist ! ' The easter feast is made of half a cadbury 's chocolate egg ; baked caremelised white chocolate ; kosher cereal from israel ; toffee crisp cereal ; home-made brownie ; creme egg ; mini eggs ; flake ; dulce de leche ; salted caramel sauce ; three milks ; marshmallows and m & m 's .

Brussels will say that google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services , which include youtube and the google+ social network . In one of the most high-profile competition cases of recent years , europe could fine google more than £4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in europe to the perceived dominance of us tech companies . Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in europe 's search engine market . The european union will accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . But the ruling - the result of a five-year investigation into the american search giant – means google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to brussels . Margrethe vestager , the eu 's competition commissioner , will today serve the company with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules , according to the financial times . Google 's competitors , including the computer giant microsoft and sites such as travel booking firm expedia and tripadvisor , claim that its method of promoting its own companies above rivals on its search site stops them competing on a level playing field . And in a further blow to google , the eu is also expected to probe google 's operating system for android smartphones . The investigation will centre on whether google imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps , such as youtube . Google has previously rejected the allegations , and insisted that android is an open platform that is distributed for free . Margrethe vestager , the eu 's competition commissioner , will today serve google with a formal charge sheet . After charges are issued , google will have ten weeks to reply to brussels , according to the financial times . They will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing . The investigation into google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms . Google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case . Most recently , just over a year ago , it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website . However europe initially accepted that deal , only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions . Vestager , europe 's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit danish political drama series borgen , took over the job in november and vowed to take google on . Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the eu 's decade-long battle with microsoft , which ultimately cost the company £1.6 billion in fines . If google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by brussels , the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed £4 billion - about 10 per cent of google 's most recent annual revenue . The move will stop short of previous threats that the eu executive could consider breaking up google to separate its business from the search engine . Google has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years . But the latest move by the eu marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing . The search engine is far more dominant in europe than it is in the united states – where rivals like microsoft 's bing enjoy a share of the market . And there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of google from many countries in the eu . In fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals . More than two dozen european organisations have filed antitrust complaints against google . Many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in germany . They have previously called on the european regulator to force the american search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps , shopping and travel services . And in france , lawyers have this week called on google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites – but google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam . Google and the eu commission declined to comment last night . Vestager 's department is also looking into the tax affairs of amazon , starbucks , fiat and apple .

2328,97,matchsumm_out.txt,"I spoke to carl froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next . Needless to say , we were disappointed to see julio cesar chavez jnr lose at the weekend against andrzej fonfara . It wasn ’ t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of froch and chavez fighting in las vegas – a fight carl wanted . Now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what carl does next . I have held talks with gennady golovkin ’ s manager and there is also the possibility of bernard hopkins , but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for carl . Carl froch ( left ) has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may . Froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now . Froch had hoped to meet julio cesar chavez jr , but he lost to andrzej fonfara last week . There is the possibility of paul smith-andre ward in the pipeline , anthony dirrell versus badou jack for the wbc world title and andre dirrell ’ s ibf world title fight against james degale , which is the biggest bout of this trio . Anthony dirrell ’ s people have already been in touch with me about a froch fight in the event that he wins , but i wonder if it is big enough . A fight against degale still feels to me like the most probable , if he comes through against dirrell on may 23 . That is a huge fight , a proper 50-50 , but i fully believe he can do it . For me , from talking to carl , i think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return . If doesn ’ t come back this year , i don ’ t think he will . He has been a year out of the ring so let ’ s see . I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights . The possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard . He is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week . The guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money . My belief is still that it might be degale . Degale has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate – if he wins the title over in the us he will be in a great position . I mentioned golovkin before . When i was on the phone to carl he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy . He is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him ; it ’ s a fight that would get everyone talking . I am looking at it . It would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special . I wouldn ’ t want to be the one to find out how golovkin punches at the weight but carl has a sick mind like that . I ’ m not going to rule that one out . James degale ( right ) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for froch on his return . Another option for froch could be a rematch with ward , should the american beat paul smith . After a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage carl frampton-scott quigg this summer are dead in the water . We received no offers from their side and made three of our own – we offered a 50-50 split , a 60-40 in favour of the winner and also a £1.5m guarantee to frampton . I sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response . You ask yourself who is making these decisions ? It is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . Let ’ s hope they don ’ t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . Scott will move on and fight on july 18 . I can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . Scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . Carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . Hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team £1.5m to fight quigg . Anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . He is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . We are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . I saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . After the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . Watch this space .

A fight against degale still feels to me like the most probable , if he comes through against dirrell on may 23 . That is a huge fight , a proper 50-50 , but i fully believe he can do it . For me , from talking to carl , i think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return . If doesn ’ t come back this year , i don ’ t think he will . He has been a year out of the ring so let ’ s see . I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights . The possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard . He is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week . The guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money . My belief is still that it might be degale . Degale has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate – if he wins the title over in the us he will be in a great position . I mentioned golovkin before . When i was on the phone to carl he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy . He is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him ; it ’ s a fight that would get everyone talking . I am looking at it . It would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special . I wouldn ’ t want to be the one to find out how golovkin punches at the weight but carl has a sick mind like that . I ’ m not going to rule that one out . James degale ( right ) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for froch on his return . Another option for froch could be a rematch with ward , should the american beat paul smith . After a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage carl frampton-scott quigg this summer are dead in the water . We received no offers from their side and made three of our own – we offered a 50-50 split , a 60-40 in favour of the winner and also a £1.5m guarantee to frampton . I sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response . You ask yourself who is making these decisions ? It is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . Let ’ s hope they don ’ t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . Scott will move on and fight on july 18 . I can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will .
